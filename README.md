# E-commerce-App-Transaction-Data-Analysis

This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering on a publicly available e-commerce transactional dataset. The analysis was performed using Python in a Jupyter Notebook and aims to uncover key insights from the transaction behavior of customers.

## ðŸ“˜ Notebooks Included

### 1. `Ecommerce_EDA.ipynb`
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) notebook that covers:
- Loading raw CSV and Excel files (click stream, transactions, customer, product)
- Analysis of failed vs successful transactions
- Total sales revenue trends over time
- Year-wise sales breakdown
- Visualizations using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`

### 2. `Ecommerce_feature_engineering.ipynb`
Feature Engineering notebook that includes:
- Customer segmentation metrics
- Product-level summaries (e.g., frequency, promo usage)
- Time-based customer behavior features (e.g., time to conversion)
- Creation of derived metrics like promo flags, conversion indicators, and more
